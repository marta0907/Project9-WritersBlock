This is my 9th Project after finishing "100 days of code" training.
It is a web page for writers. User press a button to generate a first part of a sentence, a beginning for a novel
(using OpenAi API) and starts typing in the designated field. When after 10sec user is not writing at all, the text they wrote disappears.

I used javascript for the functions in html, flask +Bootstrap5 for the app and openai for generating the first part of the sentence.

Feel free to advise on any changes, I'm very open to suggestion on my code.

Every image I use in my Projects is my property, generated by Midjourney and corrected in Photoshop to my needs.
